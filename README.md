Building and evaluating several machine learning models in the branch of Supervised Learning to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. When using data from a peer-to-peer lending services company to apply us to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.
Here the project tries to train different supervised ML models and choose the best model that works well.
